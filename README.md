# Mighty-GCC-Resources
A centralized point to find all things related to Mighty Gamecube Controller Mods. 

If you are looking for the firmware used on a PhobGCC sold by Mighty Oak Entertainment you can find the current Phob / Gamecube compatable builds on the [Releases](https://github.com/MightyOakEntertainment/Mighty-GCC-Resources/releases) pages. While those looking for the USB-C to Switch Compatable firmware it is made by @Naxdy and is available from their Git repo [NaxGCC-FW](https://git.naxdy.org/NaxdyOrg/NaxGCC-FW). 

NaxGCC is a fork of PhobGCC where the board also acts as a single controller adapter allowing for direct connection to a PC or Switch via USB-C. His firmware also has the added benefit of a "Frame Perfect" polling method they created which allows for more consistant inputs then with an adapter. (This only benefits use on a switch / wii U or PC ie. places you would use an adapter to connect a GCC)
